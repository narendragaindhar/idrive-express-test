      description: >-
        Thank you for your your interest in using the Express service. Before
        we process your order, since this is shipping internationally, we
        wanted to make sure you were aware of the additional shipping costs of
        the order. In your location, the expected cost for this is $XX.XX USD.
        Please be advised that this only covers the cost of shipping the drive
        to you, and not the cost of return shipping.


        The charge for shipping would be applied to your IDrive account, on the
        same card on file. Please reply to this email confirming you accept
        these charges and we will process your request. If you decline, we will
        cancel your Express order, but your IDrive account will be unaffected.
        If you have any questions, please let us know by emailing us at
        support@idrive.com.


        Thanks for using IDrive!
